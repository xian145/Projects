# Porjects SetUp

to create a [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with [prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [react](https://react.dev/) and [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) we run in the terminal

```
npx create-next-app@latest name-of-the-project
```

Change directory in the terminal to the new project folder and run

```
npm install -D prisma
```

and

```
npx prisma init
```

after all look for the file ".env" and change the database url to:

```js
DATABASE_URL = "file:./dev.db";
```

This is just if you are using a local database but if you are using a server you need to add the link to that server

Don't forget to add ".env" file in ".gitignore" file.

After this create a folder in the root of the project named "lib" and inside of it create a file named "pirsma.js" and paste this:

```js
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const globalForPrisma = global;

const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma || new PrismaClient();

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;

export default prisma;
```

to modify tables and aplly that changes run in the terminal:

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

If using eslint go to the file ".eslintrc.json" and change the content with

```json
  "extends": ["next/babel","next/caore-web-vitals"]
```

And lastly but not least to install [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) we run this in the terminal inside of the project folder.

```
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

and then

```
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Search the file named "tailwind.config.cjs" and add this in the "content" field

```json
"./index.html",
"./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
```

then we look for the file "index.css" remove everything and add this three lines

```js
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

look for the "app.css" file and delete it.

## Important

Don't forget to run

```
npm install
```

to install node_modules in case you download from another computer
